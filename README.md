# **CAREER-INSIGHTS**

## 💥 Introduction

The **CAREER-INSIGHTS** project aims to bridge the gap between the education system and the job market by predicting future career trends, admissions, and job opportunities in the fields of engineering, technology, pharmacy, and management. The platform utilizes machine learning models to analyze demographic data and provide insights into career prospects, admissions, and placement trends.

The project highlights a significant disconnect between the courses offered at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels and the evolving needs of the job market. This system employs **Multiple Linear Regression, KNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost** to form an integrated framework for predicting future job sectors, admission trends, and placements. Additionally, the project involves the creation of custom datasets for **state-wise admission & placement in India, district-level data for Gujarat, startup trends, and institutional analysis**, aggregated from multiple sources.

## 💡 Why did we build this?

In India, unemployment remains a major concern, and students often lack awareness of future career opportunities while selecting their graduation courses. The changing industry demands require an adaptable system that keeps pace with evolving job trends. **CAREER-INSIGHTS** helps students make informed career choices by analyzing:
- Job trends in various industries
- Future predictions of course demand
- Placement trends in different domains
- Industry demands vs. academic curriculum
- **Program trends after SSC**
- **Trending skills analysis for curriculum upgradation and learning**

By integrating AI-driven analysis with real-world data, this project seeks to align education with employment opportunities, ensuring students acquire relevant skills for the future job market.
