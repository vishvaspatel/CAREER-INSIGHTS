## üí• Introduction

The proposed portal aims to provide a comprehensive and integrated platform for farmers, offering a range of features and services to enhance their agricultural practices. It addresses the challenges faced by farmers who need to navigate multiple platforms for information and services related to schemes, land details, APMC markets, and smart farming techniques. By providing a unique farmer ID and centralizing information, the portal streamlines access to crucial data such as scheme notifications, land details, APMC history, and facilitates processes like applying for loans and insurance.

Moreover, the portal incorporates smart farming capabilities, utilizing machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the internet of things to assist farmers with crop recommendations, disease detection, yield prediction, and weather forecasting. With the potential to make accurate future predictions based on collected farmer data, the portal holds promise in empowering farmers with valuable insights and resources for improved decision-making and agricultural outcomes.

It is built using React for the frontend, Express, Sockets Server, and Twilio for SMS service and communication, and MongoDB for the database and machine learning algorithms for disease detection, crop prediction, and crop recommendation.

## üí° Why did we build this?

The portal was built to address the challenges faced by farmers in accessing crucial agricultural information and services. It aims to streamline decision-making by providing a centralized platform with a unique farmer ID for accessing schemes, land details, APMC history, and smart farming capabilities.
